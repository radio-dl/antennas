1. Directivity pattern is drawn by taking the max as 0

2. Estimate directivity from pattern:
Total radiated power is integrated. Omnis should have around 0, 
patch/small directional antenna 5-8 dB, Yagi or horn 10-20 dB.

The above estimation is down with 2D plane and not 3D integration. Over estimate is likely
if we assume 3D symmetry and ends up not being true. 3D antennas with strong elevation lobes
(yagi, horn) the estimate might not be the best.

3. With S11 and assuming 100% radiation efficiency, we can estimate the gain as well.

Radiation efficiency can be given from the vendor or simulated, or meaured.
Typical values:
Small PCB patch/chip antenna 0.2-0.6
quarter monopole or dipole 0.7-0.9
Well designed patch 0.7-0.96
Yagi/log-periodic 0.9+


4. Measuring S11, 
open will have smith chart on the right, reflection 0 dB.
matched load smith will be in center and reflection all the way down
short circuit will have smith chart on the left, reflection 0 dB.
